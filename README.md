# hello-world
My first repository. It's not for any project. I may add anything I like to it.

The repository is built based on GitHub "Get started" tutorial.
## Something about me
I'm an undergraduate in **Xidian University**, majoring in **Computer Science**.

I'm interested in machine learning, especially the recommender system.

I'd like to communicate with anybody friendly from students like me to experienced developer, hoping for your commitments and suggestions.

**Have fun in my Git-world!**:smiley:
## A saying treasured by me
骐骥一跃，不能十步；驽马十驾，功在不舍。
