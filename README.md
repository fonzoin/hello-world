# hello-world
My first repository. It's not for any project. I may add anything I like to it.

The repository is built based on GitHub "Get started" tutorial.
## Something about me
~~Noob, learning in XDU (Xidian University), a crazy Dragonborn, a loyal Wumi (fans of Wu Bai, an awesome Chinese singer)... All these things mixed up can be ME!!~~(划掉)

Actually I'm an undergraduate in **Xidian University**, majoring in **Computer Science**.

I wish to join front-end development in the future.

I'm still learning basic knowlegde of Computer Science, focusing on in-class subjects. But I'm also interested in cyber security and machine learning.

I'd like to study front-end development on my own and work hard in Leetcode and job skills. After all, "技多不压身".

I'd like to communicate with anybody friendly from students like me to experienced developer, hoping for your commitments and suggestions.

**Have fun in my Git-world!**:smiley:
