# hello-world
My first repository. It's not for any project. I may add anything I like to it.

The repository is built based on GitHub "Get started" tutorial.
## Something about me
Actually I'm an undergraduate in **Xidian University**, majoring in **Computer Science**. I wish to join front-end development in the future. I'm still learning basic knowlegde of Computer Science, focusing on in-class subjects.

I'd like to communicate with anybody friendly from students like me to experienced developer, hoping for your commitments and suggestions.

**Have fun in my Git-world!**:smiley:
